# Plant Phenotyping System

## Aim
The project aims to develop a plant phenotyping framework that constructs 3-dimensional
(3D) models of plants from images and extracts useful metrics from the models to enable
the monitoring of plant traits over time. Additionally, methods for segmentation of the 3D
plant models will be investigated.
